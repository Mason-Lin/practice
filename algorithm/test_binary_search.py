# Tips:
# Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible elements;
# Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this: after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition function;
# Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.

# when to use it?
# If we can discover some kind of monotonicity, for example, if condition(k) is True then condition(k + 1) is True, then we can consider binary search.
